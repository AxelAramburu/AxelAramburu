## Developer 👨‍💻
Hi, I'm a Smart Contract Web3 developer, worked for some projects, mainly for startups where I wrote and deploy smart contracts mostly in Solidity, made wallet integrations, made frontend integrations, manage databases, etc..
I also work on a Web2 company to make a website (Frontend/Backend/Backoffice) like Amazon/Ebay from scratch.

   There are a list of **private projects** I worked on: 
   - More a Web2 project, a Website like Ebay/Amazon for a web agency, project in progress...
   - MEV Arbitrage Bot on Solana and Ethereum chains

## Security Researcher 🛡️
I'm also a bug hunter/auditor and a security researcher on Blockchain/Web3, mostly on Ethereum and Solana chain. I'm very passionate with Zk Rollup and bridge/cross-chain technologies.
I made a lot of audits on Code4rena and hunting bugs on ImmuneFi.
I audits projects like DEX/AMM, NFT's game, Staking protocol, Crosschain bridge, ZK projects, Uniswap V4 Fork, etc
