## Developer üë®‚Äçüíª
Hi, I'm a Smart Contract Web3 developer, worked for some projects, mainly for startups where I wrote and deploy smart contracts mostly in Solidity, made wallet integrations, frontend integrations, manage databases, etc..
I actually working as a full stack developer/QA Engineer in a Web2 company where we're building solutions for sport broadcasting live and replays.

### üë∑Projects : 
   There are a list of **public projects** I worked on for Web3: 
   - [MEV Arbitrage Bot on Solana and Ethereum chains](https://github.com/AxelAramburu/MEV_Bot_Solana)
   - [Solana cNft Program](https://github.com/AxelAramburu/solana-c-nft)

## Security Researcher üõ°Ô∏è
I'm also a bug hunter/auditor and a security researcher on Blockchain/Web3, mostly on Ethereum and Solana chain. I'm very passionate with Zk Rollup and bridge/cross-chain technologies.
I made a lot of audits on Code4rena and hunting bugs on ImmuneFi.
I audits projects like DEX/AMM, NFT's game, Staking protocol, Crosschain bridge, ZK projects, Uniswap V4 Fork, etc
